# Cash register
Thi is a windows application that simulates a cash register (with on-screen keyboard), which allows:

- Enter an initial balance into the cash register(administrator defined < $50,000)
- Record the value of each item to be purchased (list) or delete items from the purchase. 
- Calculate the total value of the purchase (enter the value the user pays for and display the change (returned)).
- Request withdrawal from the cash box when an amount of $200,000 is exceeded, leaving a value of $30,000 as the basis. 
- Balance of total income, expenses and total cash available in the cashier.
